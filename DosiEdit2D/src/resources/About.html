 <h1>Help content about the DosiVox2D interface</h1>
 
 <h2>Presentation</h2>
 
 <p>This software has been developped by <b>Alan Guitard</b>, student in Computer Science at Bordeaux University, under the supervision of <b>Norbert Mercier</b>
 and <b>Lo&iuml;c Martin</b>, in the laboratory IRAMAT-CRP2A. It has been made to be used with the DosiVox2d software. 
 This interface allows to create a voxelized world with, besides, a 2D render of that object.
 So, you can easily manipulate the world, build your project and generates pilot text files (PTF) to run the simulation in DosiVox2d.</p>
 
 <h2>Just few things you have to know about the interface manipulation</h2>
 
 <ul>
	 <li>When you save the project, you does not generate the Pilot Text File.</li>
	 <li>In the "Project information" area, press ENTER has the effect to validate values. The current fields stays red-bordered. But don't worry, the field is updated.</li> 
	 <li>You can run the DosiVox2d simulation into the simulation itself. Go to Project -> Run... and a window will appear to let </li>
 </ul>
