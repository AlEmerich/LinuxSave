 <h1>Help content about the DosiVox3D interface</h1>
 
 <h2>Presentation</h2>
 
 <p>This software has been developped by <b>Alan Guitard</b>, student in Computer Science at Bordeaux University, under the supervision of <b>Norbert Mercier</b>
 and <b>Lo&iuml;c Martin</b>, in the laboratory IRAMAT-CRP2A. It has been made to be used with the DosiVox software. 
 This interface allows to create a voxelized world with, besides, a 3D render of that object.
 So, you can easily manipulate the world, build your project and generates pilot text files (PTF) to run the simulation in DosiVox.</p>
 
 <h2>Just few things you have to know about the interface manipulation</h2>
 
 <ul>
	 <li>When you save the project, you does not generate the Pilot Text File.</li>
	 <li>In the "Global" tab, press ENTER has the same effect of the button "Validate Values of the fields into the object". But, 
	 when you validate by pressing ENTER, the current fields stays red-bordered. Don't worry, the field is updated.</li>
	 <li>The button just under, "Reload object's information into fields", has the reverse effect of the one above.
	 It erase the non-updated fields and put the object's information into it.</li>
	 <li>To create a sub-world into a voxel, you have to check the sub-voxelized probe. Enter the information of the sub-world into 
	 fields "Internal Voxelization" and then, click on "create internal 3D scene" to create the world. After that, you will can change
	 this value dynamically, like the External World.</li>
	 <li>To load a 3D-scan into the object, the step is the same than above but you have to check "check to load a grey scale image". 
	 You don't need to enter values into fields. Then when you on "create internal 3D scene", the interface will read the files. After that,
	 you will have to associate material with grey scale detected. (With big object, the loading can be long)</li>
	 <li>In the editor tab, there is a second view on the South West of the window. This view is not editable, and the current layer
	 is not connect with the 3D scene. It is just an additional view to have a better manipulation of the object.</li>	 
	 <li>In the duplicate window, to select more than one layer, you have to click on it pressing CTRL.</li>
 </ul>
