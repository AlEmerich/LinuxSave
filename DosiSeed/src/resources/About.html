 <h1>Help content about the DosiSeed interface</h1>
 
 <h2>Presentation</h2>
 
 <p>This software has been developped by <b>Alan Guitard</b>, student in Computer Science at Bordeaux University, under the direction of <b>Norbert Mercier</b>
 and <b>Lo&iuml;c Martin</b>, in the laboratory IRAMAT-CRP2A. It has been made to be used with the DosiSeed software. 
 This interface allows to create materials and to describe sizes and types of grains in table window.
 So, you can easily build your project and generates pilot text files (PTF) to run the simulation in DosiSeed.</p>
 
 <h2>Just few things you have to know about the interface manipulation</h2>
 
 <ul>
	 <li>When you save the project, you does not generate the Pilot Text File.</li>
	 <li>You can run the DosiSeed software from that present interface in "Project"->"Run...". A window will appear allowing you to seek
	 	the path of the DosiSeed executable and to put the parameter of the software. DosiSeed is available only on UNIX operating system
	 	(like Linux or MacOS), this option is available just on it as well. </li>	 
 </ul>
